# Contributing to RinkJam

Thank you for your interest in RinkJam! This public repository is designed for community engagement, issue reporting, and support for the RinkJam iOS app.

The app’s source code lives in a separate private repository, so contributions here focus on:

- Reporting bugs
- Requesting features
- Asking questions
- Providing general feedback

---

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you've found a bug in the RinkJam app:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
2. **Use the bug report template** when creating a new issue.
3. **Provide detailed information**, including:
   - Device model and iOS version
   - RinkJam app version (from the app settings/about screen)
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Screenshots or screen recordings (if applicable)
   - Any relevant audio setup details (Bluetooth, AirPlay, external mixer, etc.)

### Requesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions and ideas that improve the live-game experience.

When requesting a feature:

1. **Check existing feature requests** to see if it’s already been suggested.
2. **Use the feature request template.**
3. **Describe the problem** or use case (e.g., “I want to quickly trigger multiple clips in sequence during warmups”).
4. **Explain your proposed solution** or how you imagine it working in the app.
5. **Mention any alternatives** you’ve considered.

### Asking Questions

If you’re not sure how something works or you’re planning a complex setup:

1. **Search existing issues** — your question might already be answered.
2. **Use the question template** when creating a new issue.
3. **Be specific** about what you're trying to accomplish (e.g., Apple Music + local clips, Bluetooth speakers, etc.).
4. **Include context** such as your venue setup, device, and any constraints.

## Issue Guidelines

When creating an issue:

- **Use a clear, descriptive title.**
- **Fill out the template completely** — it helps us help you faster.
- **One topic per issue** — don’t combine multiple bugs or features.
- **Be respectful** — follow our Code of Conduct.
- **Stay on topic** — keep discussions focused on the issue.

Issues may be labeled to help organize and track them (for example: `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`, `needs-more-info`, etc.).

## What to Expect

- We’ll review new issues as time allows.
- We may ask for additional information or clarifications.
- Not all feature requests can be implemented, but all will be considered.
- We’ll provide updates on progress when there is something concrete to share.

Response times may vary based on workload and release cycles.
